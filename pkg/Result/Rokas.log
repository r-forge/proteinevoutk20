Rooted tree(s) input but current criterion and/or option settings would specify
unrooted trees.  Do you want to "deroot" the tree(s)? (Y/n) paup> y


1 tree converted from rooted to unrooted.

paup> lscore;


Likelihood scores of tree(s) in memory:
  Likelihood settings:
    Number of substitution types  = 6
    Substitution rate-matrix parameters estimated via ML
    Assumed nucleotide frequencies (empirical frequencies):
      A=0.31065  C=0.18365  G=0.20955  T=0.29615
    Among-site rate variation:
      Assumed proportion of invariable sites  = estimated
      Distribution of rates at variable sites = gamma (discrete approximation)
        Shape parameter (alpha)   = estimated
        Number of rate categories = 4
        Representation of average rate for each category = mean
    These settings correspond to the GTR+G+I model
    Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 8899
    Molecular clock not enforced
    Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
    Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20,
                                 delta=1e-06
    -ln L (unconstrained) = unavailable due to missing-data and/or ambiguities
