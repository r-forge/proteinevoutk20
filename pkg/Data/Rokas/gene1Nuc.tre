>Heuristic search settings:
>  Optimality criterion = likelihood
>    Likelihood settings:
>      Substitution rate-matrix parameters estimated via ML
>      Assumed nucleotide frequencies (empirical frequencies):
>        A=0.24419  C=0.21789  G=0.20385  T=0.33407
>      Among-site rate variation:
>        Assumed proportion of invariable sites  = none
>        Distribution of rates at variable sites = equal
>      These settings correspond to the GTR model
>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 567
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected
>        without additional iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20,
>                                   delta=1e-06
>      -ln L (unconstrained) = 7789.86151
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>  Addition sequence: as-is
>  Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
>  Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'MaxTrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  Topological constraints not enforced
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>Heuristic search completed
>   Total number of rearrangements tried = 130
>   Score of best tree(s) found = 9746.95140
>   Number of trees retained = 1
>   Time used = 54 sec (CPU time = 53.90 sec)
