Character-status summary:
  Current optimality criterion = parsimony
  No characters are excluded
  Of 127026 total characters:
    All characters are of type 'unord'
    All characters have equal weight
    55232 characters are constant
    31906 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
    Number of parsimony-informative characters = 39888

Taxon-status summary:
   Original data matrix contains 8 taxa
   No taxa have been deleted
   No taxa have been assigned to the outgroup: outgroup defaults to first taxon (Scer)
